# S Pen PC Remote

Connect to your PC using your Galaxy Ultra phone and use the S Pen for presentations.

S Pen button single click = Next slide
S Pen button double click = Previous slide
S Pen button pressed = Laser Pointer

Note: This is a proof of concept and the code is quite messy. This is also my first native Android app ever.
